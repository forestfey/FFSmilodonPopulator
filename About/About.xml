  <description> Adds a +/- new but quite rare apex predator to biomes, Smilodon Populator, also known as big sabre-toothed cat. Comes with 4 different sprites for its different developmental stages. Doesn't turn down human meat and is quite strong, so beware! Caravan-ready with modified pack textures.</description>
